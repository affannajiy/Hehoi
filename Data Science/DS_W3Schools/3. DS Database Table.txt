**Database Table**

Table is not a realistic table in the real world where we put anything on top of it.
A "Table" in the data realm is are boxes.

So, a table consists of Rows and Column
Row is the horizontal part of the table which goes from left to right or vice versa.
Column is the vertical part of the table which goes from top to bottom or vice versa.

--Variables in a Table--
Definition: Variables are just spaces to fill in any information (data), it can change its values, cuz it's a variable that varies, geddit?

So, usually we will see in a typical table, where we have a typical row and column. 
The situation may be like Student Table. Student Table consists of Student ID and Student Name.
Student ID in the first column, Student Name is the second column next to it.

The rows will be used to store the values of the columns.
If the class has 30 students in it, logically there would be 30 rows for all the students' name and ID.
