Steps for a Data Scientist
  1. Identify Problem - To understand the business problem. (Ask the right questions)
  2. Explore and Collect Data - From database, web logs, customer feedback, etc.
  3. Extract Data - Transform the data to a standardized format.
  4. Clean Data - Remove erroneous values from the data.
  5. Find and replace missing values - Check for missing values and replace them with a suitable value (e.g. an average value).
  6. Normalize Data - Scale the values in a practical range (e.g. 140 cm is smaller than 1,8 m. However, the number 140 is larger than 1,8. - so scaling is important).
  7. Analyze data, find patterns and make future predictions.
  8. Represent the result - Present the result with useful insights in a way the "company" can understand.
